# 👋 Hello developer!
This site will give you a simple walk through of how to set up a Github Pages site using Github Desktop and your favorite IDE.


## 🏗 What's next?

Build your project however you like using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Use these four files as your starting point:

- **README.md:** This is the file that you are reading now. You can change the text in this file to leave information to others about your website - or delete it.
- **index.html:** This is the default page for your space, where you write HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **styles.css:** Use the CSS file to style your content and change the look of your space with beautiful colors, fonts and much more. 
- **scripts.js:** Use this file to make your website dynamic and interactive with JavaScript. 

> **Note:** The **styles.css** and **scripts.js** files link into the **index.html** file so that they are all connected.


## 🎨 Where to find everything

- **Fonts:** Add your favorite from **Google fonts**.
